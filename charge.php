3. In a fight sequence, James Bond kills the villain onboard a moving train. The train breaks down over a gorge and the bridge is about to explode. There are transmission lines below and no other means of escape visible. The transmission lines are carrying 11000V and hang between two poles on either side of the gorge. Bond makes the jump and ends up alive on the mountain on one side of the gorge. How was he able to pull it off?

6. In an ideal case, for a circuit consisting of a 1kOhm resistor connected to a 1V battery, the current should be 1mA. If you actually build such a circuit however, the current is unlikely to be what you would expect. What are some reasons to explain this other than wire resistances?
<br>
<br>
Ans : <?php echo $q6; ?>
<br>
<br>
